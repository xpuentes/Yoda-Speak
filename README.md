Not that long ago, in galaxy not so far away, this very galaxy actually, I was bored and decided to create this. Just input some text and hit the "Yodafy Me!" button, and hear it like Yoda would say it (kinda). Not all phrases will work.
Built in React, it uses the <a href='https://github.com/richchurcher/yoda-api'>yoda-api</a> by Rick Churcher to translate into Yodish and <a href='https://responsivevoice.org/api/'>ResponsiveVoice.js</a> for text to speech.
